# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a simple web application built with Node.js and Express. It serves static files and provides an API endpoint that responds with JSON data. This project demonstrates the setup of a basic server using Express, including serving HTML files and handling API requests.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- npm (npm is included with Node.js)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/user-workspace.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd user-workspace
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Server
Run the following command to start the application:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will start and be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Accessing the Application
- Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to view the main application.
- The application serves a static file (`index-table.html`) located in the `public` directory.

### API Endpoint
You can access the API endpoint by sending a request to `/data`. It will return a JSON object:
```json
{
  "message": "hello"
}
```

## Features
- Serves static files from the `public` directory.
- API endpoint that provides JSON data.
- Basic structure for handling HTTP requests with Express.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies (as specified in `package.json`):
- **express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

For a complete list of dependencies, check the `package-lock.json` file.

## Project Structure
```
user-workspace/
├── public/
│   ├── index-table.html
│   └── script.js
├── index.js                 # Main application file
├── package.json             # Project metadata and dependencies
└── package-lock.json        # Lock file for installed dependencies
```

### Directory Details
- **public/**: Contains static files such as HTML and JavaScript that the server will serve.
- **index.js**: The entry point for the application where the Express server is created and APIs are defined.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies and scripts.
- **package-lock.json**: Tracks the exact versions of installed dependencies to ensure consistent installs.

### HTML and JavaScript
- The application uses a simple HTML file (`index-table.html`) alongside a JavaScript file (`script.js`) for handling client-side interactions, such as fetching data from the server when a button is clicked.
